# 🎣 Fishing Game in C++

## What is this game about?
This is a simple console-based fishing simulation game implemented in C++. The player selects between two types of fishing styles—peaceful and predatory—and manages actions like casting a line, waiting for bites, and deciding what to do with caught fish (selling them or storing them in inventory). Players earn money by selling their catches and track their progress through statistics.
